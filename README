NAME
    Net::XIPCloud - Perl extension for interacting with Internap's XIPCloud
    storage platform

SYNOPSIS
    use Net::XIPCloud;

    # create a new XIPCloud object my $xip = Net::XIPCloud->new( username =>
    'myusername', password => 'mypassword );

    # connect to the cloud (required for all other operations)
    $xip->connect();

    # list all containers $xip->ls();

    # list contents of a container named "mycontainer"
    $xip->ls("mycontainer");

    # create a new container called "mycontainer"
    $xip->mkdir("newcontainer");

    # remove a container called "somecontainer" along with its contents
    $xip->rmdir("somecontainer");

    # get utilization stats for the entire account $xip->du();

    # get utilization stats for a singe container called "somecontainer"
    $xip->du("somecontainer");

    # get the contents of the "someobject" object within the "somecontainer"
    container my $data = $xip->get_value("somecontainer","someobject");

    # place contents of the "someobject" object within the "somecontainer"
    container into "/tmp/someobject"
    $xip->get_file("somecontainer","someobject","/tmp/someobject");

    # place the contents of $data into the "someobject" object within
    "somecontainer"
    $xip->put_value("somecontainer","someobject",$data,"text/html");

    # place the contents of "/tmp/someobject" into the "someobject" object
    within "somecontainer"
    $xip->put_file("somecontainer","someobject","/tmp/someobject","text/html
    ");

    # delete an object $xip->rm("somecontainer","someobject");

DESCRIPTION
    This perl module creates an XIPCloud object, which allows direct
    manipulation of objects and containers within Internap's XIPCloud
    storage.

    A valid XIPCloud account is required to use this module

  new( username => 'username', password => 'password');
    Returns a reference to a new XIPCloud object. This method requires
    passing of a valid username and password.

  connect()
    Connects to XIPCloud using the username and password provids in the
    new() call.

    Method returns 1 for success and undef for failure.

  ls([CONTAINER])
    Depending on the calling arguments, this method returns the list of
    containers or list of objects within a single container as an array
    reference.

    Limit and marker values may be provided (see API documentation) for
    pagination.

  mkdir("somecontainer")
    This method creates a new container. It returns 1 for success and undef
    for failure.

  rmdir("somecontainer")
    This method removes a container and its contents. It returns 1 for
    success and undef for failure.

  du([CONTAINER])
    Depending on calling arguments, this method returns account or
    container-level statistics as a hash reference.

  get_value("somecontainer","someobject")
    This method returns a scalar value, containing the body of the requested
    object.

  put_value("somecontainer","someobject","..data..","text/html")
    This method places the contents of a passed scalar into the specified
    container and object.

    Content-type may be specified, but is optional. It defaults to
    "text/plain"

  get_file("somecontainer","someobject","/tmp/destfile")
    This method places the contents of the requested object in a target
    location of the filesystem.

  put_file("somecontainer","someobject","/tmp/sourcefile","text/html")
    This method places the contents of a specified source file into an
    object.

  rm("somecontainer","someobject")
    This method removes an object.
